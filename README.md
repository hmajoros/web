###Important Server Stuffs

*So I don't forget when I come back to this after a few months off*

mostly followed this tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04) on setting up DO with flask / nginx / uWSGI

##### Files you may need
1. nginx conf: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
2. uwsgi conf: `~/web/app.ini`
3. upstart script: `/etc/init/web-server`
